Our Project named as "Plagiarism Checkrista" is a plagiarism checking tool. It is built in Django. It takes input in the form of text and checks it with other documents available in database resulting in providing the plagiarised content.

## 🛠 TOOLS

- 📋 An editor **Vs Code** or it can be any Python IDE like **PyCharm** or **Atom**.
- 🐍Python installed. 
- 🚀Django installed in virtual environment.

We are required to design a plagiarism checker tool.It will take two English text files and check them for plagiarism by comparing content in those two files.Highlighting similar content from both files.In this user will enter two different files or URls of two different files or multiple files.
It is helpful for catching cheating and plagiarism content between two files.
We will also use Django for back-end as it is an open source framework.In Actual use of Python for back-end too.It will be used with the collaboration of MYSQL query to extract data from DBMS.We will use Django dbshell.
We will try our best to meet all the requirements we discussed above and try to add more functionalities too .
It will be a web development tool designed in the Django framework which is a collection of Python libraries -one of the top web development language.Django is useful for writing APIs ,its main purpose is as a framework for creating full stack websites. For creating UIs of the website we will use HTML and CSS.Django is written in Python.So it makes it clear we are going to implement our algorithm using Python.We are using it for its flexibility,reliability,scalability and simplicity.Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common Web development tasks. Django takes care of user authentication, content administration etc .So, we can rather put too much effort in designing front-end but the real program implementation.We personally are interested in Python because it is not only an easy language but also very importantly code break at minor mistakes.It makes it very easy to use and one of the easiest to work on language.
Algorithm that will be used to implement this tool will be the Longest Common Sub-sequence (LCS). LCS can be implemented using dynamic programming or can be  recursively but we will be following dynamic programming problem solving technique to find optimal solution.

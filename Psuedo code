PSUEDO CODE FOR PLAGIRISM CHECKRISTA 
 This code checks similarity between two files given ny the user. 
 Iteratable object that are lines in our document dealt as  list
 We need to convert them into strings.To deal with them as single 
 concatenated string.and further performing comparison .
 Split function splits the string at the separator and returns a string
 to split the whole string into sentences determined by '.' (the sepaartor).
 Then a simple nested for loop that is checking similartity of first file with second file and appending in first file the similar content
 the final arrray storing all the similar content lines 


open file1
text1=read file1
open file2
text2=read file2
str1=join text1
str2=join text2
sent_text1=str1.split('.') 
sent_text2=str2.split('.') 
Final_list=[]              
for z=0 to sent_text1 
 for y=0 to sent_text2 
  if z==y
   Final_list.append(z)
